The first file (Machine Learning - Project (Classification 1-6 and MultiLabel Classification).ipynb) contains the following tasks:
   * Classification (Datasets 1 - 5)
   * Prediction (Dataset 6)
   * Multi-label classification

The second file (Machine Learning - Project (Missing Value Estimation).ipynb) contains the following tasks:

**NOTE:** In order to execute these scripts, just open any of these files and click on the "Open in Colab" button located at the top. Once located in the Google Colab platform, all the dataset files must be uploaded. After that, on the Google Colab Platform, go to Runtime -> Run All in order to execute all Python scripts (the whole process may take around 2 hours)
